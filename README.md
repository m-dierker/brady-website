=======

Repository for my personal site. Mostly going to be filled with circuits. Tried to keep it as Open Source as possible.

## Back + Front End
Designed with Flask server side, and lots of PureCSS on the yours

## Simulator
Circuits simulated using the ngspice package from UC Berkeley

## Schematics
Drawn using the Python SchemDraw package

## Plots
SPICE output parsed to CSV and plotted using Octave, SVG for maximum zoominess

## Words
I thought some thoughts 


## Development Instructions
